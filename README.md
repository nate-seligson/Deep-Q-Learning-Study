# Deep Q Learning || Jun 2024
  I researched Q Learning and Deep Q Learning to create a couple small Python programs that showcase my understanding. First, I learned about the Bellman equation and Q-Tables and attempted to make Tic-Tac-Toe, which you will see in intro.py. That simulation didn't end up working because of bugs in the tic-tac-toe framework and small issues with the Q-table. The progress and improvement of the agent was also unclear because tic-tac-toe has very limited options. Next, I tried again with a simpler idea of having a guy trying to reacha goal in a 10x10 grid, which was successful. Then, I created a framework to use Neural Networks in python and used it to recreate the same simulation but with Deep-Q learning.
